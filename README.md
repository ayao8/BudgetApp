This will eventually be a very simple React Native budgeting app that allows you to input a monthly budget. You can then add purchases that you've made and keep track of your budget. 
The bulk of the code is in /src/components/BudgetDisplay.js

I use Redux to store state so eventually I can access it from different components.
